            <h2>Computer Science Student | On my way into AI & ML</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a curious, solution-driven tech mind in the final stretch of my Computer Science degree, carving my path into AI and Machine Learning.
                I’m continuously developing my skills and trying them out in small projects, learning by experimenting and seeing what truly works in practice.
                I’m excited to see where this path leads next and genuinely interested in roles where I can grow, make meaningful contributions, and bring my strengths into a team that values impact.
            </p>
            <p>I’m currently building my portfolio and continuously improving it. </p>
